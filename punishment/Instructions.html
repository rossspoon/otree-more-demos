Your final payoff will    depend on the choices you make and the choices of others in the room.  During this game    you will be allocated points and asked to decide how much of those points you wish     to allocate to a common pool that we will call the <b>public good</b>.    </p>        <p>    During the course of this experiment, you will earn points, and at the end of experiment,     you will receive one pack of candy for every {{ conv }} points that you earned.    </p>    </div><div id="tab_2" class="disp-none">    <h1>Game Play</h1>    <p>    This experiment will consist of {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds of play.  At the beginning of     each round, you will be given {{ C.ENDOWMENT }} points as your private good.     </p>        <p>    You will then be asked how many of those points you wish to give to the public good.      All contributions to the public good are multiplied by a factor of {{ mult }}.  For expample,    there are 3 participants in the room and everyone contributes 2 points to the public good,    the public good will be worth 9 points.   ( 3 participants x 2 points per participant x 1.5 = 9)    </p>        <p>    After the value of the public good is determined, it is divided evenly among all     of the participants.  To continue the above expamle, the 3 participants will each be    given 3 points.   Note that the public good is divided equally among all participants    regardless of how much an individual participant contributed.    </p>        <p>    The first page of each round will present you with a text box in which you may enter an amount    you wish to contribute.  The amount may be between 0 and {{ C.ENDOWMENT }}.  You will    play a total of {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds.    </p></div><div id="tab_3" class="disp-none">    <h1>Punishment</h1>    <p>    You will play a total of {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds.  During the last 3 rounds, you will be given a chance to    punish those individuals that you feel did not contribute enough to the public good.    </p>        <p>    After all players have made their contributions, you will be shown all contributions made by    the other players.   This page will also contain a form with which you may assign punishment    to any player. The other players will not know who assigned the punisment to them, and you will    not know who assigned punishment to the you.    </p>        <p>    Punishment is given out in points that will reduce a player's payout that round by 10% each.    So giving someone 5 punishment points will decrease that player's payout by 50%.    It is costly to you to punish others, and there will by a table that will detail the cost to you    for each level of punishment you decide to give out.    </p>    </div><div id="tab_4" class="disp-none">    <h1>End of Round</h1>    <p>    At the end of each round, you will be informed of your payout for that round.    This payout will include your share of the public good minus your contibution, any     punishment you received, and the cost of any punishment you gave.    </p>        <p>    At the end of the experiment, your final payout will be the sum of all payouts you     earned in each round.
